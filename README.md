# Hi!  I'm Ryan! :gear:

I'm a programmer and a mechanical engineer.  I write Python, Ruby, Bash, and Rust.

I really love learning new things, though, so I could probably be productive in whatever language you threw at me.  I'm actively looking for my first coding job: something full-time as a junior back-end dev, SysDevOps, SRE, tooling, or documentation engineer would be my favorite.

Here are some places around the internet you can find me:

- [My website, `assert_not magic?`](https://assertnotmagic.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/paytastic)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-palo/)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/rpalo)
- [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/profiles/rpalo)

Here are some things I've done that make me feel cool:

- I've got a one-year-old daughter and she's the coolest
- The Exercism.io blog published [this post I wrote](https://exercism.io/blog/coding-intentionally-in-bash-grains) about mentoring the Bash track
- I was a technical reviewer for Brian Hogan's [Small, Sharp Software Tools](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhcldev/#resources) book
- I was also a technical reviewer for his other book, [Build Websites with Hugo](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/)
- I'm currently a technical reviewer for Jason C. McDonald's [Dead Simple Python](https://dev.to/codemouse92/dead-simple-python-an-announcement-276j) book
