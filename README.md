# Hi!  I'm Ryan! :gear:

I'm a programmer and a mechanical engineer.  I work at Flashpoint and work in Python, Go, Rust, Typescript, and some other languages.

I really love teaching, learning new things, and building things that make people's lives easier.  I'm always open to new work, so reach out if you've got a Senior SWE position, or some contract work for software dev, CAD, or mechanical design.

Here are some places around the internet you can find me:

- [My website, `assert_not magic?`](https://assertnotmagic.com)
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-palo/)
- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/rpalo)
- [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/profiles/rpalo)

Here are some things I've done that make me feel cool:

- I've got three daughters and they are the coolest
- I was a technical reviewer on [Dead Simple Python](https://nostarch.com/dead-simple-python), [Small, Sharp Software Tools](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhcldev/#resources), and [Build Websites with Hugo](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhhugo/)
- The Exercism.io blog published [this post I wrote](https://exercism.io/blog/coding-intentionally-in-bash-grains) about mentoring the Bash track
